    "# Cleaning & Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we're going to be working with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment(DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) insitute in Queensland, Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to find out the following ;\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the insitutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction ? What about employees who have been there longer ?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction ? What about older employees ?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll combine the results from both surveys to answer these questions. Some of the columns we'll be working with from the DETE survey are;\n",
    "- ID : an id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- SeparationType : the reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- Cease Date : the year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "- DETE Start Date : the year the person began employment with DETE\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns we'll be working with from the TAFE survey are;\n",
    "- Record ID : an id used to identify the participant of the survey \n",
    "- Reason for ceasing employment : the reason why the person's emlpoyment ended\n",
    "- LengthofService Overall. Overall Length of Service at Insitute (in years) : length of the person's employment"
