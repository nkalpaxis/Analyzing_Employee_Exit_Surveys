# Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys

In this project we're going to be working with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment(DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) insitute in Queensland, Australia. We'll be analyzing employee dissatisfaction and uncover if there is dissatisfaction amongst newer or veteran employees.
